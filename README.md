# qua-ken
this repository holds the design resources for the open source keyboard 'qua-ken'. The qua-ken is heavily inspired by [Josef Adamčík](https://github.com/josefadamcik)'s [Sofle](https://github.com/josefadamcik/SofleKeyboard) and is basically a Sofle modified to meet a custom keyboard enthusiast's standards. The PCB is split into main board and daughter board which holds the connectors. The qua-ken uses more a powerful ARM controller with much more program memory allowing the use of more software features. For the connection of the two halves a 4P4C connector is used as the TRRS connector shorts some of the lines when plugging/unplugging the cable. Currently planned are PCB silicone dumbbell gasket mount and plate top mount. The case is planned as screwless design opening from the top for ease of access. I also think about using the ball catch system gaining popularity, but since I have no experience with mechanical design, I am unsure whether I can manage that in a reasonable amount of revisions.

# Status
I just started and am currently working on the PCB. Once the PCB is tested, I will start with the case

# Can you I this keyboard when it's finished?
Yes and No. I will not open a shop and sell units myself, but the resources will all be accessible in this repository, so you can order all the parts yourself. You can also find a manufacturer and sell this keyboard as long as you credit this repository appropriately.
